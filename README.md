After cloning this repository, please ensure to provide the App ID and Token ID, as well as the channel name (you can have this value from agora console). These values are not provided in the repository due to security purposes. Before utilizing the app, it's worth noting that I used Storyboards in the UI implementation; however, feel free to modify it according to your preferences.
